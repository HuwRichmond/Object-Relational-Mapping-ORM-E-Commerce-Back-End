# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## About the Application

Application was made based on the following description "Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database."

This application is not deployed, so instead there is a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality included with the repository. A link to the video recording on Google Drive is included below on the Readme and the repository also contains the recording in the "Assets" folder.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
